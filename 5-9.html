            <h1> Music</h1>
            <p>Music is a universal art form that organizes sounds using rhythm, melody, and harmony to express feelings, tell stories, and bring people together. 
              It can be created and experienced through singing, playing instruments, dancing, and listening. Music has therapeutic benefits, improving memory, 
              focus, and communication, and serves as a fundamental part of human culture and history. It's often called a universal language because it transcends
              cultures and can communicate emotions without words.</p>
